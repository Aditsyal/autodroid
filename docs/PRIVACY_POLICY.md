# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 3, 2026

AutoDroid ("we", "us", or "our") operates the AutoDroid mobile application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

## Information Collection and Use

### Data Storage

AutoDroid is designed with privacy in mind. All automation rules (macros), execution logs, and variable values are stored **locally on your device**. We do not upload this data to any external servers or cloud services.

### Permissions

To provide automation features, AutoDroid requires various system permissions:

- **Accessibility Service**: Used to detect app launches and automate UI interactions. This data is processed in real-time and never stored or transmitted.
- **Location**: Used for geofencing triggers. Your location data is used only for local trigger evaluation.
- **SMS/Phone**: Used to send messages or make calls as part of your configured macros.
- **Files/Storage**: Used for importing/exporting macros and storing crash logs.

## Data Security

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Since your data is stored locally, its security depends on the security of your device.

## Service Providers

We do not use third-party service providers that have access to your personal data.

## Crash Reporting

In the event of an app crash, technical logs may be written to your device's local storage. These logs contain information about the crash (stack traces) and do not contain personal information. You may choose to share these logs with us for troubleshooting purposes.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
